<h2>Run Doctor!</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Play as a doctor racing to get to the hospital to perform an emergency heart transplant to save a life!
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Organ Donor
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
<br>Input: clickable button<br>Randomness: a lot of randomness<br>Play styles: Competitor<br>Genres: platformer/side-scroller
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
The goal is for the player to enjoy a high-paced game that keeps them on their toes with randomly generated enemies.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
In the prototype, the player can only jump to avoid obstacles. The only control is the on-screen button that jumps. If this game were to be pursued further, added elements could include more controls, possibly a combat system of attacking enemies instead of just trying to avoid them, and different levels with different enemies and degrees of difficulty.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
Side-scrolling, using on-screen buttons to control the player, and randomly spawning in enemies for a certain duration.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
Different enemies spawn at random windows of time. The on-screen button instead of keyboard controls makes it very easily playable on a mobile device that has a touchscreen.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
Premise is just that you're a doctor running across town to get to a hospital in time to perform emergency surgery.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
You play as a doctor who's woken up in the middle of the night to a call asking him to rush to the hospital to perform an emergency heart transplant. He finds his car won't start, so he has to run to the hospital and avoid all the weird stuff that comes out at night to save the patient's life.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Audience could be kids at least 10-12 years of age and up.t
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
The prototype takes up to 90 seconds to play (player must last that long to win).
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Because of how long a jump takes, the player shouldn't wait until the last possible second to jump, because the next enemy will spawn and hit you before you can jump again. Instead the player should time jumps as early as possible to maximize their time to jump between enemies.
</li>
