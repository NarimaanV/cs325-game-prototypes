<h2>Asteroid Outlaw</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Protect the earth against a deadly storm of asteroids as the only space outlaw who can!
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Cowboys and Asteroids
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
The game is a basic shoot'em up.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
The goal is to have fun while also honing in your skills and reflexes at accurately hitting the asteroids
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The gameplay within the protoype is fairly simple. The outlaw moves up and down and can shoot at the incoming, randomly generated asteroids. The controls are as follows:
    <ul>
        <li>Move up: Up arrow key</li>
        <li>Move down: Down Arrow key</li>
        <li>Shoot: Space</li>
    </ul>
Outside this prototype, there will be far more expansive features like multiple weapons, multiple levels, and different difficulties.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
Basic shooting mechanics and collision management.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
Astertoids spawn completely randomly from off-screen, so the player has very little time to react.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
There isn't much of a backstory. The main character is the space outlaw (currently unnamed). 
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
The game doesn't have much of a story but the basic premise is this: You play as an infamous space outlaw who doesn't care about anyone but himself. When a storm of asteroids threaten to destroy his home planet earth, he finds himself having to put his selfishness aside to protect an entire plante from certain destruction.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
A single sentence that describes the demographic you're trying to reach.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
The prototype level takes exactly 1 minute to play as an asteroid spawns every second and 60 spawn in total. This can be varied in different levels if they spawn at different rates or have more/less asteroids.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
The only strategy is staying focused and prepared to move the outlaw in any direction at a moments notice. Only possible tip could be to try staying in the middle as much as possible to prevent having to race to the other side of the screen and barely make it to shooting an asteroid.
</li>
