<h2>Asteroid Outlaw</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Protect the earth against a deadly storm of asteroids as the only space outlaw who can!
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Major theme of the game is protecting the world
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
The game is a basic shoot'em up.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
The goal is to have fun while also honing in your skills and reflexes at accurately hitting the asteroids
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The gameplay within the protoype is fairly simple. The cowboy moves up and down and can shoot at the incoming, randomly generated asteroids. The controls are as follows:
    <ul>
        <li>Move up: Up arrow key</li>
        <li>Move down: Down Arrow key</li>
        <li>Shoot: Space</li>
    </ul>
Outside this prototype, there will be far more expansive features like multiple weapons, multiple levels.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
What game mechanic is this prototype evaluating?
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
What are the unique aspects of your game that set it apart?
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, put it here. If the game is abstract, then say so.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
If the game has a story (or you envision a story for the full game), summarize it in a paragraph. How will the dramatic tension interact with the gameplay tension?
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
A single sentence that describes the demographic you're trying to reach.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
How long does your game take to play?
</li>
