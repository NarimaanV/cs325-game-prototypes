<h2>RPS Crash!</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
    Immersed in the world of Rock, Paper, Scissors, traverse as quickly as you can, beating as many foes as possible to score the most amount of points!
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Kind of car accidents, except instead of different colored cars, I used literal rock paper scissors so the player instantly knows which beats which.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
Keyboard input, simple arcade game, the enemies are randomly generated
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Goal is for the player to for the player to have fun in trying to race to gain as many points as possible while not rushing so much that they collide with a "stronger" enemy.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The player is either a rock, a paper, or a pair of scissors (random every time). They have 60 seconds to score as many points as possible by colliding with as many "weaker" objects as they can (if they're rock, hitting scissors will gain them points). If the player collides with an object "stronger" than them, they lose. If the player collides with an object "weaker" than them, they become that "weaker" object and gain 10 points. If the player collides with the same kind of object, nothing happens. Controls
    <ul>
    <li> Move Up: Up Arrow</li>
    <li> Move Left: Left Arrow</li>
    <li> Move Right: Right Arrow</li>
    </ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
The biggest mechanic I tried implementing here was an "infinite" world comprised of a background that keeps scrolling and having enemies spawn and despawn off screen to appear as if the player is moving up, even though the enemies are actually spawning and moving down. Also the collision system of having three "kinds" of objects that each win against one object and loses against another.
