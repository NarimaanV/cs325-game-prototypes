<h2>Escape the Curse!</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Help this noble warrior cursed by an evil wizard escape this dungeon before he fades from existence!
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Invisibility
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
<br>Input: keyboard<br>Randomness: deterministic<br>Play styles: explorer<br>Genres: overhead/adventure/puzzle
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
The goal is for the player to use their brain to go through the dungeon and avoid the monsters, but also remember to keep an eye on there warrior's invisibility.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The main gameplay is walking through the dungeon. The player has to avoid the monsters which and also make sure they don't go completely invisible. If they go completely invisible or run into a monster they lose. The anti-magic areas (giant pink orbs) around the dungeon reset the player's invisibility so it's good to keep in mind where the closest one is in case you are close to going completely invisible. If developed further, some features that could be added are multiple levels that are much more complex and maze-like, a combat system with the monsters instead of completely avoiding them, and powerups to make certain parts of dungeons easier. <br>Controls: Arrow keys to move
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
This game is testing repetative motion for enemies (still has a few kinks but mostly works), using tilemaps, having the camera follow the player around, having essentially a death-counter always going for the player, and also using sprite sheets for an animated player character.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
The most unique part of this game is the player's character continually going invisible unless they reset the invisibility.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
The setting is a dungeon that a warrior is locked in by an evil wizard who cursed him with invisibility that will eventually kill him.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
The player plays as a warrior who's been cursed to fade from existence by an evil wizard. He must delay the curse while escaping the dungeon and the monsters within to lift the curse.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Anybody 10 or older who can understand how you're constantly going more and more invisible.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
Anywhere between a minute to five minutes depending on how fast the player tries going through the dungeon
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Main strategy will probably be staying in an anti-magic zone when not moving and surveying what is on the screen ahead of you to avoid suprises.
