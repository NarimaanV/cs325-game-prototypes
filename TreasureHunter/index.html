<h2>Treasure Hunter</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Scavenge the depths of an ancient crypt to find priceless gems while avoiding deadly gems in near-complete darkness as fast as you can!
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Person who glows in the dark
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
Keyboard input, the gems spawn completely randomly, and the player is an explorer
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
The player should have fun trying to get the jewels as fast as they can and compete with their friends for the fastest time</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
Controls: MOVE WITH THE ARROW KEYS. 
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
What game mechanic is this prototype evaluating?
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
What are the unique aspects of your game that set it apart?
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, put it here. If the game is abstract, then say so.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
If the game has a story (or you envision a story for the full game), summarize it in a paragraph. How will the dramatic tension interact with the gameplay tension?
</li>

How long does your game take to play?
