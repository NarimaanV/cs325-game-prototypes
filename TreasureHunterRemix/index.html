<h2>Treasure Hunter</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Scavenge the depths of an ancient crypt to find priceless gems while avoiding deadly gems in near-complete darkness as fast as you can!
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Person who glows in the dark
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
Keyboard input, the gems spawn completely randomly, and the player is an explorer
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
The player should have fun trying to get the jewels as fast as they can and compete with their friends for the fastest time</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
Controls: MOVE WITH THE ARROW KEYS.<br>
Objective: Collect 3 white jewels as quickly as possible. Avoid the red jewels as 3 of those will kill you. Green jewel makes your field of vision bigger, purple jewel makes your field of vision smaller
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
Limited field of view, "smart" random spawn generator
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
The player's field of view is dynamic with different jewels, and the random spawns of the jewels makes every game different.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
Game is abstract
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
No story.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Any age group that can understand the rules can play
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
Depends on the player. Can take 30 seconds or several minutes dependong on how careful the player is.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Find a good balance of moving quickly to minimize time spend while also not moving so fast that you carelessly hit negative jewels and lose.
</li>
